## YAML file edition

Many projects use the YAML format in their configuration files.

If you need to add a new parameter, you could use the
[Symfony2 YAML component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/index.html),
which is a small library allowing you to convert a YAML file to a PHP array and
vis-versa.

The only problem with it: it doesn't keep comments or empty lines.

Redaktilo fits perfectly for the job.
