## JSON file edition

Some projects use the JSON format in their configuration files (like
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)).

Just like with Symfony2 YAML component, I could use `json_encode` and
`json_decode` to edit these files, but I would lose empty lines and indentation.

Redaktilo is again a good candidate.
