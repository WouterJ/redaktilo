# Introduction

Redaktilo allows your code to add new content to any text files. Its name comes
from "tekstoredaktilo" which means "text editor" in esperanto.

A "text file", as opposed to "binary files", can contain much more than plain
text: JSON, YAML, PHP or anything you want!

To see how to use it, have a look at the following documentation:

* [Usage introduction](usage/01-introduction.md)
* [Editor usage](usage/02-editor.md)

This small and simple library has been created to meet some actual needs.
You can discover them in the following use cases:

* [Use cases introduction](use-cases/01-introduction.md)
* [YAML configuration edition](use-cases/02-yaml-configuration-edition.md)
* [JSON configuration edition](use-cases/03-json-configuration-edition.md)
* [PHP source code edition](use-cases/04-php-source-code-edition.md)
